        <h3>Freshta Hemmati</h3>
        <p>Afghan journalist finds new ways to fight against oppression and help other newcomers</p>
        <p>Freshta Hemmati, an Afghan refugee journalist, fled to Canada in 2022 after the Taliban takeover threatened her work.
            Despite early challenges, including limited education as a refugee in Iran, she pursued journalism, earning a degree and working in Afghanistan.
            Forced to flee again in 2021, she completed a master's in Kazakhstan before arriving in Charlottetown.
            Now, she's a journalist, advocate for Afghan voices, and IRSA facilitator, expressing deep gratitude to Canada for its support.</p>

            Despite harrowing escapes and airport detentions, he found safety in Canada. Now, he's pursuing education and launching a YouTube comedy channel, expressing deep gratitude for Canada's support.</p>
