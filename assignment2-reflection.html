    <p> In this assignment I have faced several challenges which made go through all the staff that we studied until now. I watched the recordings two or three times to make a clear idea that how everything works and how to put them into action.
        finishing assignment02 almost took me three days to complete. Although, I still have difficulties in understanding of some concept. While doing the assignment it happened that I wanted to give up and stop working on it, because some css codes were not working and made me feel tired of doing the same thing again and again.
        However, after trying to many times I have come to understand that there was dome problem with my html codes that the css did not work well. during the assignment i have learned how to use Float, how to center the content, correct usage of margin, padding and borders.
        Moreover, this assignment was challenging due to my lack of knowledge of HTML and CSS and made me to watch all the recordings. At the end of the assignment I have come to understand that html and cdd need practice in order to learn them correctly.
